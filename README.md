# primefactors

Write an application that lists the prime factors of any given number.

Note: A prime number is only evenly divisible by itself and 1. 1 is NOT a prime number.

Ex: 50

50 is divisible by 2, which yields 25.   [2]
25 is not divisible by 2.                [2]  
25 is not divisible by 3.                [2]
25 is not divisible by 4.                [2]
25 is divisible by 5, which yields 5.    [2, 5, 5]
5 is only divisible by itself and 1, therefore it is prime.

Our final list of prime factors would be [2, 5, 5].
